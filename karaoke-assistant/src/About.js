      The Karaoke Assistant is a web application aimed for the use of non-singers and/or karaoke 
      enthusiasts. It allows users to detect their approximate vocal range, and to receive song 
      recommendations for the detected vocal range. It was coded using ReactJS and Node.js, and 
      it is connected to a MySQL database.
