Karaoke Assistant Web Application
=================================

This repository contains the web application created for my bachelor's thesis, supervised by dr. in≈º. Roman Podraza.

The Karaoke Assistant is a web application aimed for the use of non-singers and/or karaoke enthusiasts. It allows users to detect their approximate vocal range, and to receive song recommendations for the detected vocal range. 
The vocal range detection is done by users recording a short voice snippet. The app detects the frequency and note of the recorded snippet and maps it to the six main vocal ranges: Bass, Baritone, Tenor, Alto, Mezzo-Soprano, and Soprano.

This web application was built using React.js, NodeJS, and MySQL as a development stack.
